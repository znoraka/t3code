/**
 * Rebuild an isolated dev database from a pruned snapshot of the real
 * ~/.t3 database, then run this checkout's migrations against it.
 *
 * `vp run migrate-dev-db` from a worktree:
 *   1. Nukes `<worktree>/.t3/userdata/statev2.sqlite`.
 *   2. Snapshots the real db (`~/.t3/userdata/statev2.sqlite`, read-only
 *      VACUUM INTO) and prunes it to the most recently updated projects and,
 *      per project, the most recent threads that have fully stopped, with
 *      their forks and subagents. Working, settled, and archived threads, and
 *      threads with pending recovery, are skipped, and scheduled tasks and
 *      queued effects are dropped, so the dev server never adopts live work.
 *      Auth sessions, pairing links, command receipts, and provider
 *      runtime rows are dropped — pair a fresh browser against dev.
 *   3. Runs migrations on the result. Because the clone carries the real
 *      `effect_sql_migrations` table, this proves a new migration applies
 *      on top of the real applied set, and the slot check below catches
 *      the silent failure where two branches claim the same
 *      `Migrations/NNN_` id (the second one's CREATE TABLE is skipped).
 *
 * The event log (`orchestration_events`) is pruned per stream while
 * `sqlite_sequence` and the projection cursors carry over untouched, so new events keep appending
 * after the old high-water mark and projection cursors never rewind.
