For upstream commits, set startFromOrigin:true. Omitted workspaceStrategy means the project root, NOT the caller\'s worktree. Omit projectId/modelSelection/modes to inherit those settings from the calling thread; a caller outside a T3 thread must pass projectId and gets the project\'s default model. Set scratch:true instead of projectId for a thread without a project: it runs in a fresh folder of its own, outside any repository. Put the task in message. Do not ask the agent to create its own worktree via shell: that does not update the thread binding. Each call creates a new launch with no retry key; retain threadId and use t3_thread_read/t3_thread_wait to follow preparation. Paste the returned link when you mention the thread. After errors or lost responses, inspect t3_thread_list before retrying. Attachments must be pending uploads.
