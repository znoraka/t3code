/**
 * The OpenCode 2 runtime behind the `opencode` driver. It talks to the
 * instance's `opencode serve` process through the HTTP client and reads that
 * server's `/api/event` stream, routed here by session id.
 *
 * A turn is one `session.prompt` (or `session.command`, or `session.compact`
 * for `/compact`); the session's next `session.execution.*` terminal ends it.
 * A steer is another prompt with `delivery: "steer"`, which OpenCode reads at
 * the running execution's next step boundary, so it ends with the turn it
 * joined. Fork and rollback cut the native history before the user message a
 * turn prompted with (its `nativeTurnRef`). Each runtime mode is a set of
 * session permission rules, plan mode is also OpenCode's `plan` agent
 * (switched before the prompt like the model), and OpenCode's permission asks
 * and question forms become runtime requests on the asking session's thread, a
 * subagent's on its parent's.
 *
 * A `subagent` call runs in a child session shown as a subagent thread. A
 * background one outlives its turn; when it ends, OpenCode starts a parent
 * execution T3 did not ask for, which waits here for the continuation turn T3
 * opens for it.
