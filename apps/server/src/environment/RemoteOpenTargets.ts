/**
 * RemoteOpenTargets - resolves the SSH hostnames this environment advertises
 * for remote open-in-editor deep links (`vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+…`).
 *
 * The server can only check itself: sshd listening locally, tailscaled
 * reporting a MagicDNS name, and the machine hostname for mDNS. Whether a
 * given name resolves from the viewer's machine is inherently client-side.
 * Targets are ordered most-reachable first (tailnet name works from anywhere
 * on the tailnet; `<hostname>.local` only on the same LAN).
