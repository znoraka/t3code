/**
 * `t3 acp-mcp-bridge` — internal stdio MCP server that ACP agents spawn.
 *
 * The T3 server injects this command (with per-session endpoint and
 * credential environment variables) into `session/new` so every ACP agent
 * reaches the t3-code toolkit through ACP's required stdio MCP transport.
 * The credential stays in the environment, never on the command line.
 *
 * Real invocations dispatch through the bin.ts fast path before the CLI
 * graph loads; these definitions keep the commands wired for help and for
 * anything that drives the full CLI programmatically.
