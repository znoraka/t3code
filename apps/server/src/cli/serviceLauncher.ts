 *
 * The launcher owns SIGTERM handling and the process lifetime: it must finish
 * stopping its child before the process exits, so it runs detached from the
 * CLI's fiber rather than under `runMain`, whose signal handler would
 * interrupt the fiber and exit while the child is still being terminated.
