 * Read-only access to persisted workflow scripts for the Agents surface's
 * "{} script" affordance.
 *
 * Containment rules (lifted from the reviewed #3650 inspection service):
 * - the resolved realpath must live under ~/.claude/projects (where the
 *   Claude harness persists workflow scripts) — realpath re-containment
 *   defeats symlink escapes, including a symlinked leaf file;
 * - only .js leaf files are served;
 * - reads are size-capped rather than failed, with a truncation marker.
 *
 * The client-supplied path is a hint from the workflow's runHandles; it is
 * never trusted beyond these checks.
