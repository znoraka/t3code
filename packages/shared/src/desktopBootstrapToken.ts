 * sides derive the bootstrap token for a time window from it, so the token the
 * renderer holds rotates every window without the desktop having to reach a
 * running backend. A backend accepts the previous, current and next window's
 * token: the previous one so a token works for between one and two windows,
 * and the next one because a WSL backend's clock can trail the Windows clock
 * that derived the token, which would otherwise reject every fresh token for
 * a moment after each boundary. A token is still dead two windows after it
 * was issued.
