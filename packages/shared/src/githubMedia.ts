 * Media a pull request body points at on GitHub's own hosts. In a private repository GitHub
 * answers an unauthenticated request for one with 404 — a screenshot dropped into a description
 * becomes `github.com/user-attachments/assets/<id>`, and a file committed alongside the code
 * becomes a `raw.githubusercontent.com` path — so the renderer, which carries no GitHub session,
 * draws a broken image where the reviewer expects the evidence. The server can fetch these with
 * the `gh` credential and hand the bytes back.
 *
 * Only hosts where a credential is what decides the answer belong here. `objects.githubusercontent.com`
 * and the `private-user-images` links GitHub's own HTML carries are already signed and load on their
 * own, and a token does nothing for them once that signature expires.
