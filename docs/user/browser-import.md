# Import browser sessions

The desktop app can import cookies from another browser so you can reuse its signed-in sessions
in the preview browser.

Open **Settings → Integrations → Browser profiles → Add profile**, then choose a browser under
**Import from**. Close the source browser before importing, and allow an operating-system keyring
unlock prompt if one appears.

This is a one-time copy. Later login changes stay separate between the two browsers, and some
sites may still require you to sign in again.

On Windows, import supports Firefox and Helium profiles that use standard profile encryption.
Other Chromium-based browsers use app-bound encryption and cannot be imported. Partitioned cookies
are skipped on all platforms.
