# Keeping T3 Code in Sync

The T3 Code web or desktop app and the server it connects to work best when they use the same
version. If they do not match, T3 Code shows a warning with the right update option for that server.

## Where to Find the Update

You may see the warning in either of these places:

- above the message box in the current conversation
- **Settings** → **Connections**, beside the affected connection

Dismissing the conversation warning only hides that reminder for those two versions. It does not
update the server, and the version difference remains visible in Connections.

## Before You Update

Updating restarts the server, so the connection will disappear briefly. **Settings** → **General**
has a **Continue threads after server updates** preference. It is off by default. When enabled, the
update buttons automatically resume supported provider threads after the replacement server is
ready. Providers with native promptless continuation use it; other providers receive a short
instruction to continue where they left off. Terminal commands and other running work may still be
interrupted during the update.

The update does not remove saved threads, settings, or project files.

| **Update server**          | Available for the T3 Code Linux background service and for servers run by a current T3 Code desktop app. Select the button and leave T3 Code open while it downloads, installs, restarts, and reconnects. For desktop-app servers this closes and relaunches the desktop app on that machine. If installation fails, the desktop app stays open and reconnects to its server. |
| **Update the desktop app** | Shown for desktop apps that predate remote updates. Open the T3 Code desktop app on the machine that runs the server and install the app update there. Reopen it if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Copy update command**    | Copy the command, open a terminal on the server machine, stop the current T3 Code server, and relaunch it with the copied command and any startup options you normally use.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The available action depends on how that server was started. T3 Code does not update connected
servers silently in the background.

An older background-service launcher may ask you to run the exact
`npx t3@<version> service update` command on the server machine. That one local update installs the
rollback support needed for later remote updates, including versions that change the database.

After selecting **Update**, the notice becomes a live status line: **Downloading…** while the new
version is fetched and verified, then **Restarting…** while the server restarts into it. The same
status appears in the conversation and in Connections, so navigating between them does not lose the
update. A failure remains visible with its error and an option to retry.

**Copy update command** gives you `npx t3@<client-version>`, which relaunches the server directly
at the matching version. Add whatever startup options you normally use.

If the server instead runs as the T3 Code background service, update the service on the host and
pin the same version:

```sh
npx t3@<client-version> service update
```

`service update` installs the version of the CLI that invoked it, so `npx t3@latest service update`
only resolves the skew when your client happens to be on the latest release. The exact version from
the warning always works.

See [Running T3 Code in the Background](./background-service.md) for install, status, and removal
commands.

## Nightly desktop release notes

The desktop app shows a compact release-notes preview when a nightly update is available. Changes
appear newest first within each release. Each release links to its exact page on GitHub, even when
all changes fit in the preview.

The preview shows up to eight changes from each of six releases. When it leaves out changes or older
releases, it shows the exact number and links to the rest. Contributor credits do not count as
changes.

## After the Update

Keep the web or desktop app open while the server restarts. The update completes only after the
service launcher reports that exact update committed and the replacement server is ready to accept
commands. A rollback is reported immediately instead of waiting for a generic reconnect timeout.

If a step fails:

1. Retry the offered action once.
2. Make sure you updated the machine named in the warning, not only the device you are using.
3. For a command-line server, relaunch it with `npx t3@<client-version>`, replacing
   `<client-version>` with the client version shown in the warning.

## The Mobile App

The mobile app keeps itself current on its own. When it finds a new version, it downloads it in the
background and installs it automatically the next time you leave the app. Unsent drafts and queued
messages are saved before the restart. Only if the app stays open long enough that the update never
gets that chance does it ask whether to install right away; choosing **Later** is safe and keeps the
automatic install armed.
