# Development

## First checkout

Install `vp` using the [root README](../../README.md#install-vp). The checkout requires Node 24;
Bun is optional. From the repository root:

```sh
vp i
vp run dev
```

Open the one-time pairing URL printed by the dev runner. The bare origin does not authenticate
a new browser.

## Choosing a dev process

Use `vp run dev` for server and web, or `vp run dev:desktop` for the Electron client.
`dev:server` and `dev:web` start those processes separately.
See the [mobile README](../../apps/mobile/README.md) for native builds and Metro.

Flags go directly after the task name, for example `vp run dev --home-dir /tmp/t3code-dev`.
Add `--browser` to open a browser automatically.

### State and ports

Linked worktrees default to their own `.t3/userdata`, even when `T3CODE_HOME` is set.
The main checkout defaults to `~/.t3/dev/userdata`. An explicit `--home-dir` wins in both cases.
Never run a development server against the live `~/.t3/userdata`.
See [test data](../../AGENTS.md#test-data) for copying a consistent database snapshot.

Read ports from the `[dev-runner]` output. Worktrees derive stable preferences from their paths,
but occupied ports can shift them. `T3CODE_PORT_OFFSET` or `T3CODE_DEV_INSTANCE` can select a
different preference when needed.

### Sharing and remote debugging

`vp run dev --share` publishes the web port over the machine's tailnet and prints a pairing URL
for that origin. Give the tester the complete URL, including its token. The dev runner removes
its mapping on exit.

Leave `VITE_HTTP_URL` and `VITE_WS_URL` unset. Vite proxies the backend through the browser's
origin so the same build works over localhost and remote connections.

Shared runs enable bundled dev to avoid a network round trip for each import level.
`T3CODE_BUNDLED_DEV=0` opts out when debugging bundler differences. Two reload traps matter
when changing this setup:

- The web entry must dynamically import the app so React refresh initializes before application
  chunks. Static imports can work on first load and fail after a route split.
- Bundled dev rebuilds Tailwind through watched files. Its ordinary Vite hot-update hook expects
  a server/module graph that Rolldown does not provide.

The workarounds live in the [web entry](../../apps/web/src/bootstrap.ts) and
[Tailwind plugin](../../apps/web/vite/tailwind.ts).

## Checks

Run checks for the files and packages you changed:

```sh
vp test run <files>
vp lint <files>
vp run --filter <package> typecheck
```

Use `vp run lint:mobile` for native mobile changes. CI owns the full suite; see
[ci.yml](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) for its current jobs.
The [manual Windows lane](../../.github/workflows/windows-tests.yml) is available for focused
Windows investigation while that suite is not a required gate.

## Desktop artifacts

Local artifact builds are unsigned by default and write to `release/`:

```sh
vp run dist:desktop:dmg
vp run dist:desktop:linux
vp run dist:desktop:win
```

DMGs default to the host architecture. Use `--arch` to choose another target and `--keep-stage`
to retain packaging files for inspection. Run `vp run dist:desktop:artifact --help` for other
options.

### Linux AppImage prerequisites

Build on Linux because the browser-secret helper links against the host's libsecret. Install
Rust, C/C++ build tools, libsecret development headers, pkg-config, and ImageMagick.

Ubuntu and Debian:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cargo rustc build-essential libsecret-1-dev pkg-config imagemagick
```

Fedora:

```sh
sudo dnf install rust cargo gcc gcc-c++ make libsecret-devel pkgconf-pkg-config ImageMagick
```

Arch Linux:

```sh
sudo pacman -S rust base-devel libsecret pkgconf imagemagick
```

The C toolchain, pkg-config, and libsecret headers are also needed for Linux desktop development.

### macOS DMG prerequisites

Install the Xcode Command Line Tools with `xcode-select --install` and install Rust.
For a cross-architecture or universal build, add the requested Rust targets:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
```

### Windows installer prerequisites

Install Rust, Python 3, and Visual Studio Build Tools with **Desktop development with C++**.
Include the Windows SDK and the MSVC build tools and Spectre-mitigated libraries for the target
architecture. Add its Rust target:

```powershell
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
# For an ARM64 installer:
rustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc
```

NSIS is downloaded by electron-builder. WSL support additionally needs a Linux node-pty prebuild;
see the [release runbook](./release.md#windows-payload-topology-and-update-validation).

### Signing and passkeys

Add `--signed` after configuring the platform credentials in the
[release runbook](./release.md). macOS passkeys need a signed, provisioned app; follow the
[Connect setup](./connect-setup.md#desktop-passkeys) for local signing and renderer HMR.
