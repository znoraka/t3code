// Node dev-mode hooks: run an alchemy checkout from source with no build.
//
// 1. A synchronous `resolve` hook (`module.registerHooks`) enables the
//    `bun` export condition for the monorepo's own packages (`alchemy`,
//    `@alchemy.run/*`, `@distilled.cloud/*`), whose exports map that
//    condition to `src/*.ts`. Under plain node the `import` condition
//    resolves built `lib/` output instead — requiring a `tsc -b` first,
//    and splitting the process across a src copy (the CLI) and a lib copy
//    (the user's stack, which imports `alchemy`) whenever lib is stale.
//    Packages without a `bun` condition (e.g. the published sigil) are
//    untouched — an enabled condition their exports never mention simply
//    doesn't match.
// 2. node-utils handles the actual `.ts`/`.tsx` loading with Rolldown's Oxc
//    transformer and source maps. Node's built-in TypeScript support does not
//    cover TSX and cannot apply each package's nearest tsconfig.
//
// Dev-only: the launcher (`bin/cli.js`) and the dev supervisor pass this
// via `--import` when spawning node in a checkout. Published installs run
// bundled `.js` and never load it; this file is excluded from the tarball.
// In a checkout, the source loader resolves from the workspace package.
import { enableCompileCache, registerHooks } from "node:module";

// See register-oxc.js: enabled before anything else loads so the whole graph —
// the loader's rolldown dependency and every transformed workspace file —
// is code-cached across the CLI, the dev exec child and the sidecars.
enableCompileCache();
