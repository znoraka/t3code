/**
 * Registers a resource provider with both a **live** and a **local**
 * implementation, making provider mode a first-class, per-run *and*
 * per-resource concern:
 *
 * - The `Provider(type)` service placed in context delegates to the
 *   variant for the run's default mode (`AlchemyContext.dev ? "local" :
 *   "live"`). `findProvider` resolves the concrete variant, including its
 *   optional lifecycle methods and metadata.
 * - Both variants are exposed via {@link ProviderService.modes} as lazy,
 *   memoized builders. NEITHER is constructed at registration: a variant
 *   (and the mode-specific dependency layers composed inside its thunk) is
 *   built the first time something demands it — planning a resource of
 *   this type, deleting a state row stamped with its mode, a nuke scan. A
 *   dual provider whose resources never appear in a run costs nothing, and
 *   in dev the sidecar process a local variant spawns only starts once a
 *   resource of its type is actually planned.
 *
 * Laziness mechanics: the layer is a {@link Layer.fromBuildMemo}, so the
 * build itself is memoized by layer identity (one provider instance — and
 * one instance registry for local providers — per memo-map ancestry, i.e.
 * shared across every stack build that forks the same root, exactly like
 * ordinary layers). The build receives its `MemoMap` and `Scope`; variant
 * layers are built with `Layer.buildWithMemoMap` against that same memo
 * map and scope, which means:
 *
 * - dependency layers shared between different providers' local variants
 *   (e.g. Cloudflare's `localRuntimeServices()`) are constructed exactly
 *   once, provided the thunks share the layer *reference*;
 * - lazily-built services live until the memoized entry's scope closes
 *   (when every borrowing scope has closed), like any eagerly-built
 *   provider.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * export const WorkerProvider = () =>
 *   ProviderLayer.dual(Worker, {
 *     live: () => LiveWorkerProvider(),
 *     local: () =>
 *       LocalWorkerProvider().pipe(Layer.provide(localRuntimeServices())),
 *   });
 * ```
