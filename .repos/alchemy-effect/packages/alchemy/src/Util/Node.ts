/**
 * Opt out of cross-spawn's temporary `process.chdir` dance.
 *
 * cross-spawn (bundled inside vite, wrangler, next, tinyexec, playwright,
 * tsx, prisma, …) resolves a spawn's binary by `process.chdir`ing the
 * WHOLE parent process into the spawn's `cwd`, calling `which.sync`, and
 * chdiring back. In an alchemy process — which runs many resource builds
 * and hashers concurrently on one event loop — every fiber that touches a
 * relative path can race that window and resolve against an unrelated
 * directory.
 *
 * `process.chdir.disabled = true` is NODE'S OWN convention: Node sets it
 * on `process.chdir` inside worker threads (where chdir is forbidden),
 * and cross-spawn checks it to skip the dance. Setting it on the main
 * thread opts us into the exact mode every cross-spawn copy already runs
 * in inside jest/vitest/playwright workers daily — not an untested path.
 * The flag is purely advisory: `process.chdir` itself keeps working, and
 * an audit of the dependency tree shows the only readers are bundled
 * cross-spawn copies; nothing else writes or consults it.
 *
 * Behavior delta: a spawn combining a custom `cwd` with a command that is
 * neither absolute nor on PATH (e.g. `./scripts/build.sh`). POSIX still
 * works (cross-spawn falls back to the raw command; the OS resolves it in
 * the child's cwd). On Windows that shape can fail to resolve — the same
 * limitation those tools already have inside worker threads. Everything
 * alchemy and its toolchains spawn is absolute or on PATH, and `Command`
 * resources use effect's ChildProcess (plain spawn, no cross-spawn).
